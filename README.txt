Playin around with PyQt5. 
Used the Designer application to create the UI and wrote the code from scratch using a variety of tutorials

First Page:
  when 'Set Text' push button hit, take text from the text edit and make it the text of label
  'Next Page' takes the user to the second page
Second Page:
  create a profile on the right by entering data into the 3 text boxes
  hitting 'Create Profile' adds a tuple of the three strings to a list of profiles
  hitting 'Refresh List' populates the comboBox with the names of all the profiles in the profile list
  selecting a profile name from the comboBox and hitting 'Show Profile' prints the details of the profile in labels right below the combo box
  'previous' takes the user back to the first page
